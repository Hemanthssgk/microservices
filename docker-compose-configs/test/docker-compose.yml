# we are gonna make sure all the services are gonna run in same network.
# we require configuration up and running before any of the service starts.
# so iam setting that condtion. iam using health check every time.
# once health check is good. it is gonna trigger the dependent container.volumes:
# as all service are gonna run in their own container so  local host is not gonna work
# we need to change the host name to service name it is exposing.
